# Gateway Service

## Overview
The Gateway Service is a crucial component in our microservices architecture. It acts as an entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate backend services. This service ensures seamless communication between clients and microservices, providing features such as load balancing, security, and monitoring.

## Features
- **Request Routing**: Directs client requests to the appropriate microservice.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple instances of a service.
- **Security**: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Monitoring**: Tracks and logs request metrics for analysis and debugging.
